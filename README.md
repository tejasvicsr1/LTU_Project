# Language Typology and Universals Project
A computational approach to understanding how conditional clauses work in Telugu and English.  
***

## Introduction
**Problem Statement** - Identify and search for patterns in conditional constructions in Hindi and Telugu sentences and compare them with English.
***

## Current Knowledge
Conditional sentences are sentences that express one thing contingent on something else, e.g. "If it rains, the picnic will be cancelled". They are called because the impact of the main clause of the sentence is conditional on the dependent clause. A full conditional thus contains two clauses: the dependent clause expressing the condition, called the antecedent (or protasis); and the main clause expressing the consequence, called the consequent (or apodosis).

## Types Of Conditionals

### Zero Conditional
> **Form** - _(If + Present Simple, ... Present Simple)_

> **Example** - If you boil water to hundred degrees, then it boils.

### First Conditional
> **Form** - _(If + Present Simple, will + Infinitive)_

> **Example** - If it rains tomorrow, then we will go to the cinema.

### Second Conditional
> **Form** - _(If + Past Simple, ... would + Infinitve)_

> **Example** - If I had a lot of money, I would travel around the world.

### Third Conditional
> **Form** - _(If + Past Perfect, ... would + have + Past Participle)_

> **Example** - If I had gone to bed early, I would have caught the train.
